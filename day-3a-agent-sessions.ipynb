Drug discovery is one of the most dynamic and exciting areas where AI is making waves. Here are some of the latest developments and ongoing trends:\n\n**Key New Developments & Focus Areas:**\n\n1.  **Accelerated Target Identification and Validation:**\n    *   **AI analyzing \"omics\" data:** AI algorithms are becoming incredibly adept at sifting through massive datasets from genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics. This helps researchers identify novel disease targets (like specific genes, proteins, or pathways) that were previously undiscovered or considered too complex to analyze manually.\n    *   **Predicting target druggability:** AI can help assess whether a newly identified target is likely to be \"druggable,\" meaning if a molecule can be designed to effectively interact with it to produce a therapeutic effect.\n    *   **News highlights:** Partnerships between AI companies and biotechs focused on identifying targets for conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and various cancers.\n\n2.  **De Novo Drug Design and Molecule Generation:**\n    *   **Generative AI (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models):** These AI models are being used to *create* entirely new drug molecules from scratch, rather than just screening existing libraries. They can be designed to optimize for specific properties like efficacy, low toxicity, and good pharmacokinetic profiles (how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted).\n    *   **\"Chinchilla-like\" models for molecular generation:** Inspired by advancements in large language models, researchers are developing very large models specifically trained on vast chemical and biological datasets to design novel compounds.\n    *   **News highlights:** Companies announcing the discovery of lead compounds using AI-driven design, with some entering preclinical testing.\n\n3.  **Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity Early:**\n    *   **In silico screening and prediction:** AI can simulate how a drug candidate will behave in the body, predicting its effectiveness against a disease and potential side effects, often before it even reaches lab testing. This significantly reduces the time and cost associated with experimental screening.\n    *   **Learning from adverse events:** AI is being used to analyze vast amounts of clinical trial data and real-world evidence to identify patterns associated with adverse drug reactions, helping to flag potential issues early.\n    *   **News often features:** Studies demonstrating AI's ability to predict drug response in specific patient populations or identify potential toxicity issues in early-stage compounds.\n\n4.  **Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n    *   **AI-driven repurposing platforms:** AI can analyze drug databases, scientific literature, and disease pathways to identify existing drugs that might be effective against new diseases. This is often faster and less risky than developing entirely new drugs, as their safety profiles are already known.\n    *   **Examples:** During the COVID-19 pandemic, AI played a role in identifying potential existing treatments.\n    *   **News highlights:** Ongoing efforts to repurpose drugs for rare diseases or emerging infectious threats.\n\n5.  **Optimizing Clinical Trial Design and Patient Selection:**\n    *   **AI identifying optimal patient cohorts:** By analyzing patient data, AI can identify specific patient subgroups that are most likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more successful and efficient clinical trials.\n    *   **Predicting trial outcomes:** AI models can help forecast the likelihood of success for a clinical trial, allowing for better resource allocation and risk management.\n    *   **News often covers:** How AI is being integrated into the design of trials for complex diseases.\n\n**Examples of Companies and Approaches:**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for its end-to-end AI platform for drug discovery, from target identification to molecule generation, and has advanced several AI-discovered drugs into clinical trials.\n*   **Atomwise:** Focuses on using deep learning for small molecule drug discovery, predicting how well molecules will bind to target proteins.\n*   **Exscientia:** Employs AI for both small molecule and antibody drug discovery, aiming to design novel drug candidates efficiently.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Utilizes AI and automation to rapidly discover and develop drugs by analyzing cellular images and other biological data.\n*   **Big Pharma collaborations:** Major pharmaceutical companies (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis, AstraZeneca) are increasingly partnering with or acquiring AI-focused biotech firms to leverage these technologies in their R&D pipelines.\n\n**Challenges that persist:**\n\n*   **Data quality and standardization:** High-quality, diverse datasets are crucial for training effective AI models.\n*   **Validation:** Rigorous experimental validation is still essential to confirm AI-generated hypotheses and predictions.\n*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* an AI model suggests a particular molecule or target can be challenging, but crucial for trust and further refinement.\n*   **Integration into workflows:** Seamlessly integrating AI tools into traditional R&D processes requires cultural and technological shifts.\n\nThe pace of innovation in AI-driven drug discovery is remarkable, promising to significantly reduce the time, cost, and failure rates associated with bringing new medicines to patients.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Okay, let's dive deeper into the **second development** I mentioned: **De Novo Drug Design and Molecule Generation using AI.**\n\nThis area is incredibly exciting because it moves beyond simply searching existing chemical libraries for promising compounds. Instead, AI is being used to *create entirely new chemical structures* that are designed to meet specific therapeutic criteria.\n\n**What is \"De Novo\" Drug Design?**\n\n\"De novo\" is Latin for \"from the beginning.\" In drug discovery, it means designing a drug molecule from scratch, rather than modifying or selecting from pre-existing ones.\n\n**How AI Enables De Novo Design:**\n\nThe key AI technologies driving this are often **generative models**. Think of these models like highly sophisticated artists or architects who can conjure up new designs based on learned patterns and specified requirements. The most common types include:\n\n1.  **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**\n    *   **How they work:** GANs consist of two neural networks – a **generator** and a **discriminator** – that are trained against each other.\n        *   The **generator** tries to create new drug-like molecules.\n        *   The **discriminator** tries to distinguish between real molecules (from a training dataset) and the fake molecules produced by the generator.\n    *   **Outcome:** Through this adversarial process, the generator gets better and better at creating molecules that are indistinguishable from real, valid drug compounds, while also learning to optimize for desired properties.\n\n2.  **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):**\n    *   **How they work:** VAEs learn a compressed \"latent space\" representation of existing molecules. By sampling from this latent space and decoding, they can generate new, similar molecules.\n    *   **Outcome:** VAEs are good at exploring the chemical space and generating diverse molecular structures. They can also be conditioned to generate molecules with specific characteristics.\n\n3.  **Diffusion Models:**\n    *   **How they work:** These models are trained by gradually adding noise to existing molecules until they become pure noise, and then learning to reverse this process. When generating a new molecule, they start with random noise and gradually \"denoise\" it, guided by learned patterns and desired properties, until a coherent molecular structure emerges.\n    *   **Outcome:** Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in generating high-quality, novel molecules with complex 3D structures. They are often considered state-of-the-art in image generation and are now being applied to molecular design.\n\n4.  **Reinforcement Learning (RL):**\n    *   **How it's used:** RL can be coupled with generative models. The AI agent is \"rewarded\" for generating molecules that meet certain criteria (e.g., binding affinity to a target, solubility, low toxicity).\n    *   **Outcome:** RL helps fine-tune the generative process to specifically optimize for a complex set of desired drug properties.\n\n**What Makes This So Powerful?**\n\n*   **Exploring Untapped Chemical Space:** Traditional methods are limited by the vast libraries of existing compounds. De novo design allows exploration of chemical structures that may not have been synthesized or considered before.\n*   **Designing for Specificity and Efficacy:** Instead of just screening, AI can be instructed to design molecules that *specifically* target a particular protein or pathway, and are predicted to have high binding affinity and desired biological activity.\n*   **Optimizing Multiple Properties Simultaneously:** Modern AI can be trained to balance multiple desirable characteristics at once, such as:\n    *   **Binding Affinity:** How strongly the molecule interacts with its biological target.\n    *   **Selectivity:** Ensuring it binds only to the intended target and not others (reducing off-target side effects).\n    *   **ADMET Properties:** Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity – crucial for how the drug behaves in the body and its safety.\n    *   **Synthesizability:** Whether the molecule can actually be made in a lab efficiently.\n*   **Speeding Up the Early Stages:** Identifying promising lead compounds can take years. AI can generate thousands of novel, optimized candidates in a fraction of that time, significantly accelerating the preclinical phase.\n\n**News and Examples:**\n\n*   **\"Generative AI finds novel antibiotic\":** Many recent announcements highlight AI identifying completely new classes of antibiotics that are effective against drug-resistant bacteria.\n*   **AI-designed molecules entering clinical trials:** Companies like Insilico Medicine have seen their AI-generated molecules advance from discovery to human trials for conditions like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n*   **Focus on challenging targets:** AI is being applied to design molecules for previously \"undruggable\" targets, opening up new therapeutic avenues.\n\nIn essence, de novo drug design using AI is about building a highly intelligent chemical \"chef\" that can invent entirely new recipes (molecules) tailored precisely to the patient's needs, rather than just picking from a pre-made menu.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of AI-driven de novo drug design is rapidly evolving, with a mix of dedicated AI-focused biotech companies and established pharmaceutical giants leveraging these capabilities.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
